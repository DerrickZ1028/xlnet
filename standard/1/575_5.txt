Many of the changes from Kaby Lake can only be seen on the back end, but general consolidation of features into a single platform (advanced USB is now on the CPU, for example) theoretically adds appreciable speed. However, unlike advanced server-level processors with the Cascade Lake architecture, Whiskey Lake has no hardware mitigations against Spectre - thus, a 3-10% drop in performance may be seen depending on workload while the firmware fix is running. It does, however, have two hardware-level mitigations for Meltdown.
