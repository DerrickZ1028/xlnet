(For this, I have not talk about the thermal issue yet, You better repaste the laptop, use thermal pads, and undervolt it so it does not burn)Bottom line: if you are lucky, your laptop will works fine, if you are not like a lot of people who bought this model, then  you will know what I am talking about. Good luck!
