Despite the difficulty I have been having with customer service, I was going to give it one more shot with Dell, but after reading all of the complaints in discussion forums about the problems other customers have had with the XPS 15 9570 and 9560 (dead pixels, display backlight bleeding, coil whine, poor quality control on the fittings, not going to sleep properly and overheating in backpacks), I am worried what the experience might be like if I actually manage to get one of their laptops and need support with a technical problem.
