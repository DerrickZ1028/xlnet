I did for kicks install some of the popular games such as Fortnight, Rodblox, and Minecraft Windows 10 edition.Two of these games were 100% playable, which were Rodblox and Minecraft. Fortnight on the other hand was hardly playable it was getting in the 8 to 14 FPS at a low quality setting, it was dismal.
