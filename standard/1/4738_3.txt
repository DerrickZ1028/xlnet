I dont know if it's because of the fl heat in a truck to bestbuy or what the issue is but this is my 2nd one that the screen and the chasy arent 100% together and makes a super annoying click where the screen protrudes when I open it and gets slightly caught on the chasy edge making a click when it goes back into place.
