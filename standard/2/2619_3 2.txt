The features are amazing, Screen is great, and the performance is tested with different types of benchmarks and I can use it with pen in my photoshop very easily but the fan noise is killing me, I can't stand on the noise, even if the laptop is super cool and not using it for nothing, the fan is kicking and I feel like I am in an airplane.
