my SQL server almost works nothing because windows run it's options and buttons on each other and it impossible to work with that and first time I thought this problem is come from SQL but when it happened for my printer software as same and when I read article about this laptop on other forums, I saw same issue for other people then I got it is serious trouble and if it doesn't fix then I'm gonna return it because if this laptop has graphic issue means worth =000 second problem is, the fan keep making noise non-stop and laptop gets super hot that U are not able touch it, for it will burn your fingers!which is weird.
