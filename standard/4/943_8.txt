Was a decision between buying the Huawei Matebook Pro X, but the bigger screen, better battery, better CPU, better GPU, better PORTS selection (needed HDMI and USB-A capabilities), and MUCH EASIER upgradeability (just popping opening the back panel gives u instant access to the SD card, wifi card, and RAM slots) justified going for this over the 200 dollar cheaper Huwaei.
