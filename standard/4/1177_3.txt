Recreation: Watching other media like youtube and netflix, or other streaming media services like spotify is complete fine, although I will admit that the speakers are kinda bad; I would recommend getting a proper pair of headphones either way because laptop speakers aren't meant to be great imo, so I have very low standards in that regard.
