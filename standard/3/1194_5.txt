This laptop works really well, the looks and performance are overall great, I'll recommend it to anyone who ones to do some coding or video editing work but not at all recommended for music producers, since there's a small latency issue with the audio that won't allow you to work as expected, even Rocksmith has some latency issues on this laptop, but again.
