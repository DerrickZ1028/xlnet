Again. I knew it was past my warranty (by six days) but I had talked with Windows before the warranty expired to talk them about my problem because Dell usually takes forever to respond (another problem). So I told them I could verify my account with Windows, I could show them the messages I sent them, and they said no. It didnt matter because I didnt call them first.
