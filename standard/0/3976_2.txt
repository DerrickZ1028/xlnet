I was not impressed with Best Buy this time around (while shopping for a computer I was given wrong information about how long a sale price on a different computer would last which led me to rush back in on the day he told me the sale would end, to find out it was only a 2-day sale, I missed it and they would not honor what the salesman admitted he told me in the first place).
